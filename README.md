# Cpp_CSharp_Call
Example code that calles managed code written in C# from unamanged code written in C++

The code is very heavily based on [this article](http://pragmateek.com/using-c-from-native-c-with-the-help-of-ccli-v2/) from pragmateek.

The solution to the problem is to use C++/CLI as a wrapper around the managed code.
